# oxidized

A Dart package with types similar to those found in the Rust standard library,
such as the `Result` which represents either a value or an error.

## Usage

A simple usage example:

```dart
import 'package:iron_oxide/iron_oxide.dart';

main() {
  var awesome = new Awesome();
}
```

## TODO

### Option

### Result

- `err()`
- `ok()`
